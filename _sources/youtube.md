## Setup Zoom for livestreaming to Youtube

Log in to your Zoom account and go to the settings page. Under the meeting settings scroll all the way near the bottom
under in-meeting advanced and enable livestreaming of meetings. This is already done for the WASI account.
Select the streaming services you want to use. For scheduled livestreams on Youtube Custom Live streaming Service is the
one you want to use. You can paste the link, stream key and url into the box below but the key and link will change
each time. It's best just to keep them handy for when you start the Zoom meeting.
