# WASI Social Media Handbook

This is guide for managing the WASI social media presence on the internet. It includes
information and best practices for establishing and managing WASI social media accounts
and on-demand video and streaming services. You will also find some how-tos for content
creation.

The WASI presence on the internet falls broadly into two categories:first, promoting WASI
events, public outreach and education, and second, as an information resource for members.
The first should be managed by one or two people with a plan to maintain a consistent WASI
brand across all platforms. The second should be a collaborative project of many people.
There are some tools that can help with both of these goals.

This guide is an example of an information resource for members. It is a work in progress
and would benefit from the collaborative efforts of many others. It's easy, give it a try.
