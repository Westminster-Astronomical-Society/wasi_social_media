# Contributing

**This reference is a work in progress**. Suggestions, additions, corrections
and contributions are welcome. It is intended a s a community resource so input
from the community is essential.

It is composed as a Jupyter Book{cite:p}`Executable_Books_Community2020`, and
hosted on Github. There are several ways you can make contributions. At the top
of each page are links to the Github repository.

Click the Github icon <i class="fa-brands fa-github"></i> and choose:

- <i class="fa-brands fa-github"></i> Repository (will take you to the main Github repository.)
- <i class="fas fa-pencil"></i> Suggest edit (will open the source document for editing and submit a pull request.)
- <i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> Open issue (will open Github issue page for comments or suggestions.)

The repository has three branches, main, develop, and gh-pages. Changes should
be made on the develop branch. Changes pushed to the main branch will trigger an
automatic build and deployment of the site to gh-pages. The gh-pages branch
should not be modified directly.

Pages are composed in Markdown, a simple document markup syntax. Pages can alo
be authored as Jupyter notebooks. Executable content and Markdown in Jupyter
notebooks will be rendered and displayed in html.

Minor edits and suggestions can be accomplished through the Suggest edit or Open
issue options. More substantial contributions can be made by forking the
repository, cloning a local copy, and submitting a pull request with your
changes. You will need a Github account and the Jupyter Book build tools
installed locally. Installation and usage instructions can be found at
[jupyterbook.org](https://jupyterbook.org). 

The documentation has examples for
[Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/file-types/notebooks.html)
and common [Markdown](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/file-types/markdown.html)
syntax as well as [MyST Markdown](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/content/myst.html)
for more complex layouts.
